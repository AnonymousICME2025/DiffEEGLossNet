# Explanation from paper

BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa : the set contains motor imagery signals from
9 participants. The subjects were asked to imagine the movement of their left and right hand, also
their feet and tongue, for a couple of seconds after the instruction cue were presented on their screen.
Data was recorded from 22 EEG and 3 EOG channels following the 10-20 standard system. The
measurements were sampled at 250 Hz and band-pass filtered from 0.5 - 100 Hz. Furthermore, a
notch filter at 50 Hz was applied to eliminate the line noise. We further band-pass filtered the signals
between 4 - 38 Hz with a zero-phase filter and down-sampled them to 128 Hz. Following the work
of , we extracted epochs from the recordings between [0.5, 4] seconds from the onset of the cue and
normalized them by channel-wise mean subtraction and deviation division. We excluded samples
marked as rejected due to artifacts by the publishers of the set.


BCI Competition IV Dataset IIb : This dataset contains motor imagery signals from 
9 participants. During the experiment, the subjects were instructed to imagine the movement 
of their left or right hand for several seconds after the cue was displayed on the screen. 
The data were recorded using 3 EEG channels, following the 10-20 international electrode 
placement system. The recordings were sampled at 250 Hz and initially band-pass filtered 
between 0.5 and 100 Hz. A notch filter at 50 Hz was also applied to eliminate power line noise. 
Additionally, the signals were further band-pass filtered between 4 and 38 Hz using a zero-phase 
filter and down-sampled to 128 Hz. Following related works, we extracted epochs from the recordings 
in the range of [0.5, 4] seconds after the cue onset and normalized them by channel-wise mean 
subtraction and standard deviation division. Samples marked as rejected due to artifacts by the 
dataset publishers were excluded.
